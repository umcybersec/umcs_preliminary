## Description

"Youâ€™ve intercepted a mysterious floppy disk labeled 50 BLESSINGS, left behind by a shadowy figure in a rooster mask. The disk contains a cryptic image and a garbled audio file. Rumor has it the message reveals the location of a hidden safehouse tied to the 1989 Miami incident. Decrypt the clues before the Russians trace your signal."
